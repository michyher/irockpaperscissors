# USING PYTHON
Let's break it down a bit before we get started.

We are using the language Python.

Now instead of node.js, we are going to be using exclusively Python. 

I would like to repeat to my future self, WE ARE USING BAREBONE PYTHON!!!

We download packages through pip. `python3 -m pip install NAME`

This package used Numpy (python math) and opencv.
    - opencv is computer vision for python (camera stuff)
